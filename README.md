# 🧠 Word Solitaire

A simple **word association / category-based solitaire game** for mobile devices.

Instead of traditional playing cards, the game uses **word cards** and **category cards**. The goal is to place each word into the correct category using logic and associations. Main reason for making this in Finnish is because I couldn't find any Finnish versions of these types of games.

The project is planned to be built with **React Native** and run on both **Android and iOS**.

## 🎮 Game Concept

- Each level contains:
  - Category cards (for example: *Animals*, *Food*, *Jobs*)
  - Word cards (for example: *cat*, *apple*, *doctor*)
- The player:
  1. Selects a word card
  2. Selects a category card
  3. The game checks whether the word belongs to that category
- When all words are placed correctly, the level is completed.

The game focuses on **logic and thinking**, without time limits or story elements(yet).

## ✨ Planned Features

- Simple word–category matching gameplay
- One codebase for Android and iOS
- Levels defined as data (easy to add new levels)
- Clean and minimal mobile UI (for now)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (planned)

- React Native
- Expo
- TypeScript/Javascript

> Note: The project is still in an early stage and no implementation exists yet.

## 🚧 Project Status

 **Early planning stage**

Nothing has been implemented yet. The goal of this repository is to:

- Define the game idea clearly
- Serve as a base for future development

**First development stage (ONGOING)**

Made first screens and some buttons to go back and forth between screens. No gamelogic yet.

## 📌 Goals for the First Version

- One playable level
- Basic word selection and placement
- Clear success feedback when a level is completed

This project is a personal learning project and a simple game prototype (for now).
